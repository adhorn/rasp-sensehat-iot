**Goal**:
Get data from RaspberryPi with SenseHat sensor analysed in seconds on the AWS Cloud.

**AWS IoT** easily and securely connects devices through the MQTT and HTTPS protocols. The IoT Rules Engine continuously processes incoming messages, enabling your devices to interact with other AWS services.

**Amazon Elasticsearch Service** makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale Elasticsearch for log analytics, full text search, application monitoring, and more. Amazon Elasticsearch Service is a fully managed service that delivers Elasticsearchâ€™s easy-to-use APIs and real-time capabilities along with the availability, scalability, and security required by production workloads. The service offers built-in integrations with Kibana, Logstash, and AWS services including Amazon Kinesis Firehose, AWS Lambda, and Amazon CloudWatch so that you can go from raw data to actionable insights quickly.

**Amazon S3** is object storage that provides you a highly reliable, secure, and scalable storage for all your data, big or small. It is designed to deliver 99.999999999% durability, and scale past trillions of objects.

**Amazon Kinesis Firehose** allows you to capture and automatically load streaming data into Amazon Kinesis Analytics, Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon Elasticsearch Service, enabling near-real-time business intelligence and the use of dashboards.

**Amazon Athena** is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using SQL. Simply point to your data in Amazon S3, define the schema, and start querying using standard SQL, with most results delivered in seconds.

**Amazon QuickSight** is a fast, cloud-powered business analytics service that makes it easy to build visualizations, perform ad-hoc analysis, and quickly get business insights from your data. You can easily run SQL queries using Athena on data stored in S3, and build business dashboards within QuickSight.


**Prerequisites:**

* Create an Amazon Kinesis Firehose Stream with the following configuration
  ```
    Delivery stream name: Rasp-SenseHat
    S3 bucket: mys3bucketname
    S3 prefix: raw (or anything else)
    IAM role: firehose_delivery_role (default)
    Data transformation: Disabled
    Source record backup: Disabled
    S3 buffer size (MB): 5
    S3 buffer interval (sec): 60
    S3 Compression: UNCOMPRESSED
    S3 Encryption: No Encryption
    Status: ACTIVE
    Error logging: Enabled
  ```

* Create Amazon Elasticsearch Cluster (I used version 2.3)
 * create security policy to allow access from your IP address only

* Create an AWS IoT Rule with the following configuration
  ```
   Rule query statement: SELECT * FROM '<ID_of_the_RaspPI>/sensehat/data'
  ```

* Add 2 filters to the AWS IoT Rule
 * Amazon Kinesis Firehose
  ```
  Stream name: Rasp-SenseHat
  Separator: \n (newline)
  ```
 * Amazon Elasticsearch Service
  ```
  Domain name: yourESdomain
  Endpoint: https://yourESdomain.es.amazonaws.com
  ID: ${newuuid()}
  Index: sensehat
  Type: mydata (or anything else)
  ```

* Create Data mapping to Amazon Elasticsearch with the following configuration:
```
  curl -i -X PUT -d '{
    "mappings": {
      "sensehat": {
        "properties": {
          "datetime": {
            "type": "date",
            "format" : "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
          },
          "device_id": {
            "type": "string"
          },
          "yaw": {
            "type": "double"
          },
          "pitch": {
            "type": "double"
          },
          "roll": {
            "type": "double"
          },
          "pressure": {
            "type": "double"
          },
          "humidity": {
            "type": "double"
          },
          "temperature": {
            "type": "double"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ' 'https://URL/index'
  ```

* Configuring Amazon Athena

```sql
  CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE sensehat_iot_full (
      datetime timestamp,
      device_id string,
      yaw double,
      pitch double,
      roll double,
      pressure double,
      temperature double,
      humidity double
    )
  ROW FORMAT  serde 'org.apache.hive.hcatalog.data.JsonSerDe'
  with serdeproperties( 'ignore.malformed.json' = 'true' )
  LOCATION 's3://<BUCKET_NAME>/'
  ```

* Analysing the data in Amazon Quicksight via Amazon Athena:
 * Create a data source in QuickSight as follows:

```
  Log into QuickSight
  Select "manage data" and "new data set".
  Choose Athena as the new data source.
  Select the default schema and the sensehat_iot_full table created previously in Amazon Athena.
  Click Vizualise - Enjoy :)
  ```

* Connect into Kibana endpoint found from the Amazon Elasticsearch Service and create an index in setting:

```
  Index seach pattern: sensehat*
  Select datetime
  Vizualise - Enjoy :)
  ```
